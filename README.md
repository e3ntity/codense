# Codense

## Description
Codense is a command-line tool designed to summarize the contents of a web development project. This tool goes through the specified directory, minifying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files, and displaying the reduced code with file paths. If a `.gitignore` or `.codenseignore` file is present, the tool will ignore the files and directories specified in them. The output can be printed to the console or copied to the clipboard.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/e3ntity/codense.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
$ cd codense
```
3. Install the dependencies and link the package
```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn link
```
4. To run codense from anywhere, add the `~/.yarn/bin` to your path by modifying `~/.bashrc`

### Usage
Run the tool using the `codense` command followed by the directory you want to summarize. For example:
```bash
$ codense ./my-project
```

To copy the output to the clipboard, use the `-c` or `--clipboard` flag:
```bash
$ codense ./my-project --clipboard
```

#### Options
- `-c, --clipboard` Copies the output to the clipboard.

## Ignoring Files
If there are files or directories you don't want the tool to process, you can specify them in a `.gitignore` or `.codenseignore` file. The tool will read these files (if they exist) and ignore the specified files and directories.
Attention: You will have to add both `.gitignore` and `.codenseignore` to your `.codenseignore` file if you want to ignore them.

### Example .codenseignore
```
/node_modules
/dist
/test
.gitignore
.codenseignore
```
